# Product Grid Section Challenge

This project is my implementation of the [Product Grid Section Challenge](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/product-grid-section) from GreatFrontEnd. It's a responsive product grid that displays product listings with various features and states.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The challenge involved building a responsive and modular section to display product listings with the following key features:
- 4-column responsive grid layout
- Product cards with multiple states (normal, hover, focus)
- Dynamic color swatches with various states
- Price display with discount handling
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern React practices (hooks, functional components)

## 📚 Key Learnings

### 1. TypeScript Implementation
- Created proper interfaces for product data structure
- Implemented type safety for props and state management
- Learned to handle optional properties and type checking

### 2. Component Architecture
- Built modular, reusable components
- Implemented proper prop drilling
- Created separate components for complex UI elements (TickIcon, DiagonalLine)

### 3. State Management
- Used React's useState hook for managing component state
- Implemented color selection functionality
- Handled product variant states

### 4. Accessibility (ARIA)
- Added proper ARIA roles and labels
- Implemented keyboard navigation support
- Created semantic HTML structure
- Added proper focus management
- Enhanced screen reader support

### 5. Responsive Design
- Implemented mobile-first approach
- Created responsive grid layouts
- Handled different screen sizes with Tailwind breakpoints
- Optimized images and content for various devices

### 6. UI/UX Best Practices
- Implemented hover and focus states
- Created visual feedback for user interactions
- Handled out-of-stock states
- Implemented price display with discounts
